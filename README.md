# Overview

This is our first project, which is the vending machine WEB APP that can solve the traditional vending machine problem, coin stuck, always out of stock merchandise and easy to manage.

Useful verbage

- Client: an individual or group that maintains vending machines
- Compay: the entity that the machines are connected to in the code
- User: an individual who purchases from the vending machine

A Client can log on and register the vending machines they manage. ​Upon registration, a vending machine is named and given a location.​ For each machine, a flyer with a unique QR code will be generated, leading Users to a survey that allows them to report issues​. When a user completes the survey, the information goes to the website and is displayed for the Client.
